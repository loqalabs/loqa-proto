# Branch Protection Migration Test

This file is created to test the migration from repository rulesets to branch protection rules.

**Test Date**: September 2025  
**Repository**: loqa-proto  
**Issue**: [#51 - GitHub Repository Protection Migration](https://github.com/loqalabs/loqa/issues/51)

## Test Purpose

Validate that branch protection rules work correctly with simplified status check naming:
- ✅ `Check Commit Messages` (simple naming)
- ✅ `Generate Protocol Buffer Bindings` (simple naming)  
- ✅ `Validate Protocol Buffers` (simple naming)

## Expected Results

- No "stuck PR" issues due to status check naming complexity
- Status checks should match workflow job names directly
- PR should be able to merge when all checks pass
- PR should be blocked when checks fail

## Migration Success Criteria

- [ ] PR can be created successfully
- [ ] Status checks appear correctly in PR
- [ ] No manual bypass required when checks pass
- [ ] Security enforcement maintained
